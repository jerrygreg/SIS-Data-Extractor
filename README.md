# SIS-Data-Extractor
 Functions to grab and save data from Johns Hopkins University (JHU) SIS Course Search to a text file for ease of manipulation

 The main purpose of this is to save data from SIS to a text file so that you don't have to constantly do API calls when developing  a program or bug testing as the API is quite slow.
